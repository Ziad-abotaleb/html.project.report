<h2>Uses for database systems include:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
They store data and provide facilities of searching specific record in given data.</li>
<li>They store special information used to manage the data. This information is called metadata and it is not shown to all the people looking at the data.</li>
<li>They can solve cases where many users want to access (and possibly change) the same entries of data.</li>
<li>They manage access rights (who is allowed to see the data, who can change it)</li>
<li>When there are many users asking questions to the database, the questions must be answered faster. So, the last person to ask a question, can get an answer in reasonable time.</li>
<li>Certain attributes are more important than others, they can be used to find other data. This is called indexing. An index contains all the important data and can be used to find the other data.</li>
<li>They ensure that the data always has context. There are a lot of different rules that can be added to tell the database system if the data makes sense. One of the rules might say November has 30 days. Th
is means if someone wants to enter November 31 as a date, this change will be rejected.</li>
</ul>
